Overview:
- Developed a machine learning model to identify Autonomous Systems (ASNs) exhibiting behavior similar to BGP serial hijackers.
- Leveraged a diverse set of features related to ASN advertisement times, visibility metrics, MOAS conflicts, and more for robust classification.

Key Points:
- **Data Pre-processing:**
  - Conducted thorough data pre-processing, handling null values and dissimilarity checks between training and testing datasets.
  - Explored and categorized features into continuous, categorical, and redundant variables for effective analysis.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Utilized seaborn and matplotlib for EDA, including distribution plots and count plots to understand the distribution of the target variable.
  - Examined correlations among features and identified key variables influencing the classification task.

- Feature Selection and Correlation Analysis:
  - Calculated mean correlation values and set a threshold for feature selection.
  - Employed a neural network model with selected features, emphasizing interpretability and predictive power.

- Model Training and Evaluation:
  - Trained a TensorFlow-based neural network model on a scaled dataset, considering class imbalances.
  - Evaluated the model's performance on a sample test dataset, presenting accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC/PR curves.

- Prediction on Original Test Dataset:
  - Applied the trained model to predict BGP serial hijacking behavior on the original test dataset.
  - Assessed model accuracy and generated classification reports for detailed insights.

Impact:
- Contributed to the cybersecurity domain by providing a proactive approach to identifying potential BGP serial hijacking activities.
- Enhanced the understanding of ASNs' behaviors through detailed feature analysis and model-driven predictions.
